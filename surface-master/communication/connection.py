Connection
**********

Description
===========

This module is used to handle the information exchange with middle-level of the system. It uses pathos multiprocessing
and a :class:`DataManager` to handle the data flow.

Functionality
=============

Connection
----------

The :class:`Connection` class provides a TCP-based data exchange with the Raspberry Pi.

Execution
---------

To start the communication, you should create an instance of :class:`Connection` and call :func:`connect`, for example::

    connection = Connection(port=50000)
    connection.connect()

To restart the communication simply call::

    connection.reconnect()

Functions & classes
-------------------

.. note::

    Remember that the code is further described by in-line comments and docstrings.

The following list shortly summarises the functionality of each code component within the :class:`Connection` class:

    1. :class:`DataError` is a support class to handle custom exceptions
    2. :func:`__init__` builds the connection
    3. :func:`_handle_data` receives and sends the data to the Raspberry Pi
    4. :func:`_connect` runs an infinite loop to keep exchanging the data with the Pi
    5. :func:`connect` starts the connection thread
    6. :func:`reconnect` restarts the connection thread

Modifications
=============

The only functions that could require modification is :func:`_handle_data`, as the module expands. You should also
consider modifying the `self._RECONNECT_DELAY` value within :func:`__init__`.
