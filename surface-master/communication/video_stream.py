Video Stream
************

Description
===========

This module is used to handle the visual data exchange with the Raspberry Pi in a separate thread.

Functionality
=============

VideoStream
-----------

The :class:`VideoStream` class provides a TCP-based streaming of a single camera.

Execution
---------

To start the stream, you should create an instance of :class:`VideoStream` and call :func:`stream`::

    stream = VideoStream(ip=ip, port=port)
    stream.stream()

where `ip` and `port` are the connection-related values.

Functions & classes
-------------------

.. note::

    Remember that the code is further described by in-line comments and docstrings.

The following list shortly summarises the functionality of each code component within the :class:`VideoStream` class:

    1. :class:`DataError` is a support class to handle custom exceptions
    2. :func:`__init__` builds the stream object
    3. :func:`frame` is a getter for the camera frame
    4. :func:`_handle_data` receives and sends the data
    5. :func:`_connect` runs an infinite loop to keep exchanging the data (frames)
    6. :func:`stream` starts the streaming thread

Modifications
=============

The only functions that could require modification are :func:`_on_surface_disconnected` and :func:`_handle_data`, as
the module expands. You should also consider modifying the `self._TIMEOUT` value within :func:`__init__`.
